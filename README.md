# Churn_prediction_waze


Overview
This project aims to predict customer retention for the Waze application. Using advanced machine learning techniques, we have developed a churn prediction model that classifies users as either likely to be retained or churned. This model has been integrated into a user-friendly web application.

Technology Stack
Flask: The web application is built using Flask, a lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python, offering ease of use and flexibility.
Machine Learning: Our predictive model employs Random Forest Regression as the machine learning algorithms to analyze and predict user behavior. 
Python: The entire backend, including the churn prediction model, is implemented in Python, ensuring robust performance and ease of maintenance.
Features
User Input: Users can input relevant data about a Waze user, such as usage patterns, total navigation, and other behavioral indicators.
Real-Time Predictions: The application processes the input data and provides real-time predictions about whether a user is likely to be retained or churned.
Intuitive Interface: The web application features an intuitive and easy-to-navigate interface, making it accessible for users with varying levels of technical expertise.

How to Run
1. Set Up Environment: Ensure you have Python and Flask installed.
2. Run the Application: Execute the app.py Python file to start the Flask server.
3. Access the Web Application: Use the provided local host link to access the web application through your browser.
4. Enter Data: Input the necessary data about a Waze user to receive the churn prediction.
